/**
 * Client-side fallback redirect for authenticated visitors on the landing page.
 *
 * The primary path for logged-in users hitting an app host's `/` is a
 * server-side redirect in the Next.js proxy/middleware, driven by the
 * `last_workspace_slug` cookie. That cookie is set by the workspace layout on
 * every visit. But on *first login* — before the user has ever visited a
 * workspace — the cookie is absent, so the proxy falls through to the landing
 * page. This component covers that gap and sends workspace-less users through
 * automatic workspace setup on app/self-host origins.
 *
 * On the official marketing origins, `/` must remain public even for logged-in
 * users. Explicit workspace routes still open the app.
 *
 * Renders nothing. Uses `router.replace` so the landing page never enters
 * browser history for authenticated users.
