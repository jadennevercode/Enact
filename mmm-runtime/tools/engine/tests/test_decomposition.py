"""The decomposition identity, and what each driver is measured against.

Run: ``PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python -m mmm_engine.mmm._test_decomposition``

Two properties have to hold together, and only holding one of them is how the
reference case ended up reporting 竞品ND at −1907% while still "summing to 100":

1. ``baseline_pct + Σ contribution_pct == 100`` — the decomposition accounts for
   all of Y, so a share is a share of something real.
2. Every factor-tree driver keeps **its own** contribution, and a level driver
   (price, distribution rate, temperature) is measured against the level it
   actually sits at rather than against zero. Merging such drivers into the
   baseline would work here and break on the next project, whose factor tree
   names different things.
