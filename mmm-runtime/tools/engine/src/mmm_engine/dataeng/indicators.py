"""The indicator catalog, derived from the factor tree.

The Business-Understanding factor tree defines what data this project must
collect. An ``Indicator`` is therefore a *projection* of an active factor row,
not an entity the data manufactures: it exists the moment the tree is confirmed,
and publishing data attaches an ``IndicatorCoverage`` to it rather than creating
a second, parallel list that drifts.

Nothing here is stored. Persisted state is only ``factor_tree`` (the definition)
and ``indicator_coverage`` (which asset's metric supplies which row) — the same
derive-don't-store rule ``app/agents/ledger.py`` follows, for the same reason.
