"""FactorTree ↔ DataAssets mapping resolver for 2.1 Data Processing.

Every active factor-tree row (an L4 factor + its indicator) must be resolved
before Data Intake & Validation starts: either a published Data-Engine indicator
*maps* to it, or the user *ignores* it. This module derives that per-row status
from the published indicators (the single source of truth for "mapped") plus the
project's ``factor_map_ignores`` set, and exposes ``mapping_complete`` — the
predicate that clears the 2.1 gate on the Data-Engine path.
