"""Orphan review — a supplied metric the factor tree never asked for.

An orphan is not an indicator. Presenting it as one is how a data-side column
ends up looking like a project deliverable, which is what the stored catalog used
to do (``treeGrounded=False`` mixed into the same list). It gets two honest
exits: adopt it into the factor tree, or dismiss it.

Adoption writes ``source="data_upload"``, ``status="accepted"``. It does NOT go
through the S1 accept/reject gates: by the time anyone is looking at published
data, 1.21d and 1.4d are long closed, and a proposal nothing will ever accept is
just a row that silently never reaches the model.
