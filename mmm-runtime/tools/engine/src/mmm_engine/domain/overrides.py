"""Per-indicator human overrides from 2.1 Data Processing.

Two maps live on ``ProjectState`` (keyed by
``indicator_metadata.indicator_key(l4, metric)``):

* ``metric_type_overrides`` — the model role the user assigned: ``"Y"`` (response)
  / ``"X"`` (driver) / ``"excluded"`` (not in model). Applied at the ``model_df``
  seam via :func:`apply_metric_type_overrides`, so every downstream reader sees
  one consistent tagging and there is exactly one Y.
* ``aggregation_overrides`` — how the indicator rolls up across time/dimensions.
  Read by every roll-up in the pipeline via :func:`resolve_aggregation` /
  :func:`aggregation_override_for_metric`.

Absent keys fall back to the name-based classifier (``classify_indicator``), so a
project that sets no overrides — the Danone reference case, every legacy project —
resolves byte-identically to before.

This module is the **single authority** for both questions. Two resolvers exist
precisely so no downstream step re-derives them:

* :func:`resolved_y_metric` — what the model is explaining. 2.3's chart backdrop,
  2.4's Pearson and 2.5's fit all read it, so they cannot disagree about the
  response the way they used to.
* :func:`resolve_aggregation` — how a series is rolled up, honoured by the
  national collapse (2.1), the quality subchecks (2.2), the validation series and
  yearly table (2.3), the statistical screen (2.4), the design matrix (2.5) and
  the master table (2.6).
