"""The model-object key space: one model per **channel × product**.

Decision 2026-07-27, superseding the 2026-07-23 national roll-up. S2 no longer
aggregates anything before it screens or fits:

* the two scorecards (2.2 quality, 2.4 statistical) read the assembled long table
  exactly as it was published — see ``app.agents.stat_scoring`` for what that does
  to the panel the tests run on;
* the OLS stage fits **one model per ``(channel_type, brand)`` combination that
  carries a response** — N channels × M products = N×M models.

An object id is ``f"{channel_type}{OBJECT_SEP}{brand}"``. An id with no separator
is read as a bare ``channel_type``: that is the pre-2026-07-27 shape (including
the legacy ``TOTAL`` object and the ``'+'`` channel-union syntax), so an
``OlsConfig`` saved before this change still resolves against the same rows.
Everything downstream — ``ModelSelection``, ``OlsConfig``, the ``olsTree`` body,
the React view — treats the id as an opaque string, which is why widening it
needs no change there.

**Market rows are shared, not partitioned.** A brand that carries no response —
the competitor aggregate, a category total, or simply blank on generic national
spend — cannot be a model object, but its spend and activity are genuine drivers
of every product's sales in that channel. Those rows are therefore visible to
every product model in their channel rather than being split off into a model
that could never be fitted. Without this, moving from one national model to
per-product models would silently delete the competitive drivers from every fit.
