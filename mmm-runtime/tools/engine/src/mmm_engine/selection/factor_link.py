"""The bridge between a factor-tree row and the data that supplies it.

S2 has two key spaces and they had nothing joining them:

* the **factor tree** keys on a row's declared ``(l4, indicator)`` — what Business
  Understanding said it wanted to collect;
* the **data** keys on ``(l4, metric)`` — what the published assets actually
  delivered, under whatever label the source file used.

Those labels are rarely the same string. On the reference case the tree asks for
``OTV投放 · impression`` and the data delivers ``OTV · Impression``; of 123 factor
rows the human had explicitly *ignored* at 2.1, **zero** matched a data key. So
``drops_before(st, "quality")`` — the mechanism that is supposed to stop a rejected
factor from being re-scored at 2.2, re-screened at 2.4 and re-offered at 2.5 — was a
filter that never filtered anything. A factor you told the product to drop went on
being scored all the way into the model.

The join already exists in the data model and nothing was reading it: publishing
records an :class:`IndicatorCoverage` per (asset metric → factor row), so a factor
row *knows* which metric labels supply it. This module turns that into a lookup both
directions, and every S2 layer keys through it.

Ambiguity is resolved conservatively. A metric supplies at most one row (the publish
contract), but the same label can appear under two L4s, so the primary key is the
pair; a metric-only lookup is offered **only when that label is unambiguous across
the whole tree**, because guessing here silently moves a verdict onto the wrong
factor.

**Both sides of a coverage are registered, under their own L4.** A coverage records
the mart's labels *and* the factor row it supplies, and the two disagree by design —
that disagreement is the whole reason a human pins one to the other. Registering the
coverage's metric under the *factor row's* L4 therefore produces a key nothing in the
data ever uses: on the drill case the human pinned ``(站内投流, 花费)`` to the row
``电商站内投流 · 花费`` and ``(促销优惠, 花费)`` to ``买N赠N · 花费``, and the bridge
registered only the tree-side spelling, so both pins resolved to nothing. Because 50
rows of that tree declare ``花费``, the metric-only fallback declined to guess (rightly)
and the two indicators read as **orphans** — data no factor asked for — while sitting
in the model with a human's binding on them. The key a later layer filters on is the
data's, so the data's ``(l4, metric)`` must be in the map.
