"""2.5 OLS Regression Test — build the candidate model-input wide table, fast-OLS
fit it **once per model object**, and compare each indicator's ROI / Contribution
against the industry Knowledge ranges, projected onto the complete factor tree.

A model object is one ``(channel, product)`` cell: N channels × M products = N×M
regressions (2026-07-27, :mod:`app.agents.model_objects`). Each one regresses its
**whole** surviving driver universe in a single fit. There is no per-L4 indicator
search any more — the coordinate descent that used to try each factor's candidate
indicators across up to 96 trial fits is gone, and with it the premise that the
model's variables should be chosen by which combination lands the most factors
inside a Knowledge band. What a variable did to Y is now simply reported.

The wide table is derived from prior-stage data (``model_df`` + ``build_model_frame``),
excluding indicators dropped by 2.2 (quality) / 2.4 (statistical). Every active
factor-tree row is surfaced — in-model rows carry coef / t / p / ROI / Contribution
and a range verdict; out-of-range rows (ROI **or** Contribution) are flagged for
human review. The ``d-2.5`` gate then decides whether flagged indicators are
physically excluded when 2.6 assembles the final Master Data.

The result body uses the ``olsTree`` artifact format (see ``OlsTreeData`` in
``frontend/src/lib/types.ts``); all keys are camelCase, numbers are ``None`` on NaN.
