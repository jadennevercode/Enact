"""Indicator lifecycle ledger — S2's single derived truth about which factor-tree
indicators reach the model, and where the rejected ones died.

Every S2 layer already records its verdict in its own place: the factor map
(2.1), the quality scorecard (2.2d), the per-factor sign-offs (2.3), the
statistical scorecard (2.4d), the OLS config's ticked variables (2.5x) and the
``d-2.5`` range gate (2.5r). Nothing here adds new state — the ledger *derives*
each indicator's lifecycle from those records so that:

* a rejection at any layer is **inherited** by every later layer (a dropped
  indicator is never re-scored, never re-offered, never silently re-enters), and
* every downstream consumer — 2.5r's fit, 2.6's master table, 3.2's training —
  filters on one resolved :class:`ModelSelection` instead of each re-deriving
  its own (which is exactly how 3.2 came to train on unfiltered data).

The ledger is also the UI's answer to "why is this indicator not in my model?":
every row carries the full chain of per-layer verdicts, not just the outcome.
