"""2.6 Master Data — the modeling feature table, sliced on the 2.24 dimensions.

The modeling long table (the reference ``Data Process_2.24.xlsx`` schema) carries
per row: brand / province_group / channel_type / channel · year / month · the
L1–L8 factor path · METRICS type + label · VALUE. The master table is that long
table

  * restricted to the indicators the **ledger** reports as adopted — an
    indicator any S2 layer rejected can never appear here, and
  * pivoted to one column per indicator over the chosen time grain.

It is computed **live** rather than baked into the artifact: the user slices by
product × channel × region, and materializing every combination up front would
be both enormous and stale the moment a verdict changes.

    The KPI is the response, not a factor — no layer rules on it, so it is never
    in the ledger and must be admitted explicitly or the table loses its Y.

    ``model_selection``'s ``exclude``/``include`` are keyed per model object
    (channel type) so 2.5r/2.6/3.2's per-object fits never let one channel's
    drop or tick leak into another's. This mask resolves the keep/drop
    decision **per channel_type present in df** — a master-table call is
    already sliced to (at most) a handful of channels via ``_apply_dims``, so
    it walks each one's own rows against its own ``exclude_for``/
    ``include_for`` rather than flattening every object's verdicts into one
    union. That is the whole point of per-channel screening: a wide table
    sliced to one Channel Type shows exactly that channel's surviving
    indicators, and the same indicator can appear as a column in one channel
    and be absent in another.

    A row that cannot be pinned to one model object — blank ``channel_type``, or a
    ``brand`` no model object claims — is **national**: it is shared into every
    object's fit rather than belonging to one. It is therefore kept when any object
    in ``scope`` kept it, and dropped only when every one of them rejected it.
    ``scope`` defaults to every model object; pass a single object to get exactly
    that model's own input (what the per-object export sheets do). Note
    ``.astype("string")`` turns NaN into the
    literal ``"<NA>"``, which left unnormalized the per-object loop would treat as
    a real object — ``exclude_for("<NA>")`` resolves only the OBJECT_ANY-level
    drops, so a channel-specific rejection could leak in through any unmapped row.
    Hence the normalization to ``""`` up front.

    The object key is ``(channel_type, brand)`` since 2026-07-27, so the loop walks
    the composite ids ``model_selection`` is keyed by. Keying it on the bare
    channel type would have silently resolved every row through the OBJECT_ANY
    bucket and let each channel's own rejections through.
